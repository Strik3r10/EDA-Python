## 🎯 Goals of the Project

1. **Explore a banking dataset with Pandas framework** - Master data manipulation and analysis techniques
2. **Build pivot tables** - Create multi-dimensional analysis for business insights
3. **Visualize the dataset with various plot types** - Develop comprehensive visual representations of patterns

## 📊 Materials and Methods

The data used is a subset of an open source **Bank Marketing Data Set** from the UCI ML repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/citation_policy.html

> This dataset is publicly available for research. The details are described in [Moro et al., 2014].

The project addresses the task of preliminary analysis of positive responses (term deposits) to direct bank calls. This is essentially a bank scoring problem - predicting client behavior (loan default, deposit subscription, etc.) based on client characteristics.

### Dataset Details:
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Records**: 41,188 observations
- **Features**: 21 (20 input features + 1 target variable)
- **Target**: Term deposit subscription (yes/no)
- **No missing values** - Complete dataset

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

1. **NUMPY** - Numerical computations and array operations
2. **PANDAS** - Data manipulation, analysis, and pivot tables
3. **MATPLOTLIB** - Data visualization and plotting

### Additional Configuration:
```python
# Display settings for better readability
pd.set_option("precision", 2)
pd.options.display.float_format = '{:.2f}'.format
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (8, 6)
```

## 📁 Dataset Description

### Features Overview:
**Input Features (20):**

- **Financial Status**: default, housing loan, personal loan
- **Contact Information**: contact type, month, day of week, duration
- **Campaign Data**: campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome
- **Economic Indicators**: emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, cons.conf.idx, euribor3m, nr.employed

**Target Feature:**

### Data Types:
- **Numerical Features**: 10 (int64 and float64)
- **Categorical Features**: 11 (object type)

## ❓ Key Business Questions

The analysis addresses five critical questions:

1. **What is the share of clients attracted in our source data?**
   - **Answer**: 11.3% (4,640 out of 41,188 clients)

2. **What are the mean values of numerical features among the attracted clients?**
   - **Average age**: 40.91 years
   - **Average campaign contacts**: 2.05

3. **What is the average call duration for the attracted clients?**
   - **Answer**: 9 minutes 13 seconds (553 seconds)

4. **What is the average age among the attracted and unmarried clients?**
   - **Answer**: 31 years

5. **What is the average age and call duration for different types of client employment?**
   - Detailed pivot tables reveal job-specific patterns

## 📋 Project Outline

### 2. Tasks
- Top 10 clients by contact frequency
- Median age and contact analysis by education level
- Age distribution visualization by education

## 📈 Key Findings

### Client Profile Analysis:
- **Overall subscription rate**: Only 11.3% - significant improvement potential
- **Typical subscriber**: ~41 years old, requires ~2 contacts
- **Marital status impact**: 61% of clients are married
- **Age distribution**: Most clients between 25-50 years (active working population)

### Campaign Effectiveness:
- **Optimal call duration**: ~9-10 minutes for conversions
- **Best days**: Mondays and Thursdays show higher engagement
- **Peak months**: November and August
- **Longest calls**: Over 1 hour, primarily for engaged prospects

### Statistical Insights:
- **Age distribution**: Near-normal
- **Duration/Campaign**: Geometric distribution pattern
- **Outliers**: Married/divorced clients over 70, unmarried over 50

## 📊 Visualizations

### 1. Scatter Matrix
```python
pd.plotting.scatter_matrix(df[["age", "duration", "campaign"]], 
                          figsize=(15, 15), diagonal="kde")
```
- Shows pairwise relationships between numerical features
- Diagonal KDE plots reveal distribution types

### 2. Histograms
- Individual age histogram shows 25-50 year concentration
- Combined histograms for all numerical features

### 3. Box Plots
- Age by marital status
- Age by education level
- Combined analysis of age by marital status and housing loan
